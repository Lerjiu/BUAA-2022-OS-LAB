//测试pthread_join
//在umain线程中创建三个线程，thread1、thread2、thread3，然后while(b<10)循环10次，每次打印b的值后，进行syscall_yield()
//在三个线程中，进行pthread_join()，然后打印threadx: umain is end, ret is %d
//若join成功，umain线程进行syscall_yield()后，也只有umain可以调度，三个线程均会等待umain线程结束后，才继续执行
//结果如下
//再用此程序测试pthread_detach，在创建三个线程前加入一句pthread_detach(a[0]); join失败，三个线程不会等待，所有的线程按调度循环打印b的值，结果见分割线后
